        <h5>01 what is deference between local storage and session storage ?</h5>
        <p> -- <strong>local storage</strong> provides access to the Documentâ€™s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage & <strong>Session Storage</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. </p>

        <h5>02 what is deference between global scope and block scope ?</h5>
        <p> -- <strong>Function Scope</strong> When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. <strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>

        <h5>03 how JavaScript event loop works ?</h5>
        <p>-- <strong>The event loop</strong> is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed .The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser.</p>

          <li>A method or statement also returns undefined</li>
          <li>the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.</li>
          <li>A function returns undefined if a value was not returned</li>
